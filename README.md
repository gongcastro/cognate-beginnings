Do bilingual children acquire cognates earlier than non-cognates? We collected vocabulary data from 10-to-40 month old children exposed to a second language, and modelled the probability of cognate vs. non-cognate translation equivalents being understood and/or produced across ages. This repository hosts the code used to process and analyse the data, as well as the Rmarkdown files used to generate the preprint. The code and surveys used to collect and retrieve the data are hosted as a package in the [Multilex](github.org/gongcastro/multilex) repository. All other materials can be found in the [OSF](https://osf.io/hy984/) repository.

## Repository structure

This repository is organised as follows:

* **Data**: Raw data in CSV format.
* **Figures**: empty folder where figures generated by the R code will be located.
* **R**: R code used to process (`preprocessing.R`) and analyse (`analyses.R`) the data, along with some helper functions (`utils.R`).
* **Results**: RDS files with the contents of each model (e.g., MCMC samples), as generated by `brms::brm`. If you don't want to run the models (it may take some time to do so), make sure to download this folder into your local repository.
* **Rmd**: Rmarkdown files used to generate the manuscript, along with some by-products (TeX files) and a `.bib` file that contains the references in a Rmarkdownd-friendly format.
* **Stan**: Stan code used to fit the models, as generated by `brms::brm`. This code is not involved in any step of the data analysis workflow, but may be helpful for those who want to take a look at what the models look like in Stan code.
