#' Get participant-level data
#'
#' @param bvq_data A named list resulting from calling [get_bvq()]
#' @param longitudinal Should longitudinal data be included? If `"all"` (default), all responses (including repeated measures) are included. If `"no"`, participants with more than one responses to the questionnaire (regardless of the version) are excluded. If `"first"`, only the first response of each participant is included. If `"last"`, only the last response of each participant is included. If `"only"`, only responses with repeated measures are included.
#' @param age Numeric vector of length two indicating the minimum and maximum age of participants that will be included in the resulting dataset.
#' @param lp Character vector indicating the language profile (LP) of the participants that will be included in the resulting dataset. In takes `"Monolingual"`, `"Bilingual"`, and/or `"Other"` as values.
#' @param other_threshold Numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the minimum exposure to a language other than Catalan or Spanish that a participant need to be exposed to to be excluded.
