Before the end of their first year of life, infants start directing their gaze to some objects when hearing their labels, according to both experimental data [@jusczyk1995infants; @tincoff1999some; @bergelson2012months; @bergelson2015early] and parental reports [e.g., @fenson2007macarthur]. During the last half of their second year, they acquire new words at an increasingly fast rate [@goldfield1990early; @fenson1994variability; @mayor2011statistical; @bloom2002children; @bergelson2020comprehension]. These early stages of lexical acquisition are characterised by substantial variation between children, reflected, for instance, on the variation on the number of words they know [i.e. vocabulary size; @fenson1994variability; @frank2021variability] or on the proportion of those words that fall into the category of nouns, as opposed to verbs, adjectives, or function words [e.g., @nelson1973structure, bates1994developmental].


Despite this variability, children's trajectories of vocabulary growth seem quite stable across languages. @tardif2008baby collected data about the first ten words acquired by 10 to 16 month-old infants living in the United States, Hong Kong, and Beijing. Since birth, these infants had been learning English, Cantonese and Mandarin, respectively. The authors found a common pattern across the three groups: their first ten words referred to roughly the same concepts, namely relatives/caretakers (*daddy*, *mommy*), social routines (*bye*, *uh-oh*) or animals (*woof-woof*). These results were later extended by @frank2021variability to a wider diversity languages, who also reported that such cross-language commonalities are stronger at earlier stages of lexical acquisition, compared to later stages. Most of the literature on early word acquisition, however, has been conducted on monolingual children, and neglects the problem of how bilinguals--who represent a substantial proportion of the population in most societies--acquire words at early ages.


There is evidence that bilinguals know less words in each of their languages than monolinguals, but also that both groups know a similar amount of words when the two languages are aggregated. For example, @hoff2012dual found that English-Spanish bilingual toddlers in South Florida knew less words in English than monolinguals, who only learnt English. Both groups knew a similar total amount of words when both English and Spanish vocabularies were counted together, pointing to the importance of collecting data on both languages when assessing bilinguals' communicative development. Other studies have provided converging evidence that bilinguals know a similar--or even larger--number of words than monolinguals, only when the languages are aggregated [@oller2002language; @pearson1994patterns; @pearson1993lexical; @patterson2004comparing; @patterson2004bilingual; @smithson2014bilingualism; @petitto2001bilingual; @gonzalez2020bilingual]. While these studies have mostly relied on samples of bilingual children learning two relatively distant languages, as it is the case of English and Spanish, it is unclear whether children learning typologically more similar languages also know less words in each of their languages than monolinguals. What role could linguistic distance play during early vocabulary growth?


For a given set of concepts, bilingual children may be exposed to two distinct sets of word-forms--one in each language. Depending on the linguistic distance between both languages, the two sets of words may overlap in varying degrees. Particularly, when both languages are typologically close, like Spanish and Catalan (both Roman languages), they are more likely to share a large amount of cognates (i.e., form-similar translation equivalents) than two linguistically distant languages, like Spanish and English (one Roman, the other Germanic). For instance, in the presence of a door, a Spanish-Italian (or a Spanish-Catalan) bilingual might hear *puerta* and *porta* (cognates), whereas a Spanish-English bilingual might hear *puerta* and *door* (non-cognates). It could be the case that mapping two phonologically similar labels (cognates like *puerta*-*porta*) onto the same referent is easier than doing the same with two phonologically dissimilar labels (non-cognates, like *puerta* and *door*). If cognates are easier to acquire than non-cognates, bilinguals learning a pair of languages that share a high proportion of cognates should benefit more often from this facilitation effect than those learning a pair of languages with a lower proportion of cognates, and should therefore show larger vocabulary sizes.


@floccia2018introduction provided evidence in line with this claim. The authors collected vocabulary data on word comprehension and production from 372 24-month-old bilingual toddlers living in the United Kingdom who were learning English and an additional language. The additional language was one a pool of 13 typologically diverse languages: Bengali, Cantonese Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hindi/Urdu, Italian, Mandarin Chinese, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and Welsh. The authors calculated the average phonological similarity between the words in each of these additional languages and their translation equivalents in English. Phonological similarity was measured by computing the Levenshtein distance between each cross-language pair of phonological transcriptions. The Levenshtein distance is a metric that computes the edit distance between two strings by counting the smallest number of insertions, deletions and substitutions one of the strings has to go through to become identical to the other [@levenshtein1966binary]. The resulting scores were then divided by the length of the longest string to bound the similarity scores between 0 and 1, and then entered this variable as a predictor as they modelled participants' vocabulary sizes. Among other findings, the authors reported an increase in productive vocabulary size in the additional language associated with an increase in the average phonological similarity between the translation equivalents of each language pair. For example, English-Dutch bilinguals (22.14% phonological similarity), were able to produce more Dutch words than English-Mandarin bilinguals (1.97% phonological similarity) were able to produce in Mandarin.


Floccia et al. pointed to *parallel activation* as the main mechanism underpinning their results. The parallel activation hypothesis suggests that bilinguals activate both languages simultaneously during speech production or comprehension. This phenomenon is the result of the activation of lexical representations in both languages, even when only one is in use during production [@costa2000cognate; @hoshino2008cognate] or comprehension [@thierry2007brain]. One of the clearest examples of parallel activation was provided by @costa2000cognate. In this study, Catalan-Spanish monolingual and bilingual adults were asked to name pictures of common objects in Spanish. In half of the trials, the object labels were cognates in Spanish and Catalan (*Ã¡rbol*-*arbre*, translations of *tree*), whereas in the other half of the trials labels were non-cognates (*mesa*-*taula*, translations of *table*). Bilinguals named cognate pictures faster than non-cognate pictures, even after adjusting for the lexical frequency of the items. Importantly, Spanish monolinguals did not show this effect. These results suggest that, for the bilinguals, Catalan phonology was activated during the production of Spanish words, facilitating the naming of cognate pictures. Several recent studies have also provided similar evidence in comprehension in children [e.g., @von2012language; @poulin2013lexical]. Parallel activation is therefore a plausible mechanism to account for Floccia et al.'s results: cognates increase the amount of activation in both languages, facilitating word acquisition, and ultimately leading to children learning language pairs with a larger proportion of cognates are predicted to show larger vocabulary sizes. A missing piece in this account is how increase parallel activation might facilitate the acquisition new words.


In this study, we hypothesise that cognates are acquired earlier in age than non-cognates, which might explain why children learning languages that share many cognates show larger vocabulary sizes. Evidence supporting this claim is scarce. To the best of our knowledge, only two studies have provided direct data on this issue. First, @bosch2014first used vocabulary parental reports (152 lexical items) from 48 Catalan-Spanish bilinguals aged 18 months, and found that cognates represented a larger proportion of participant's vocabulary than non-cognates. Second, @schelletter2002effect reported a longitudinal single case of one English-German bilingual who produced cognates earlier than non-cognates, on average. The low sample size in these studies makes it challenging to draw strong conclusions about the effect of cognateness on vocabulary growth. Floccia et al.'s estimates are statically more reliable given their (much larger) sample size, but their study was not aimed at testing the effect of cognateness on age of acquisition directly. In their discussion the authors state the following (pp. 70):


> "This  finding  also  provides  support  to  the  proposal  that  the  cognate advantage is due to cognates being acquired before non-cognates in early childhood (Costa et al., 2016), leading to an ease of processing later in life."


We identify two main reasons why an earlier age of acquisition for cognates than for non-cognates is an unwarranted conclusion from Floccia et al.'s results. First, the response variable used was the proportion of words each participant understood and/or produced (i.e., vocabulary size), from the list of lexical items in the vocabulary checklists. By aggregating the responses from all items into a single datum per child, information about the acquisition status of cognates vs. non-cognates was lost. Second, all participants were aged ~24 months, meaning that even if the unaggregated responses to individual items were included as response variable, the possible effect of cognateness could only be interpreted as an increase or decrease in the likelihood of participants at such age to have acquired each item, and not as an increase or decrease in the age of acquisition of such item. In summary, the current evidence supporting an earlier age of acquisition of cognates vs. non-cognates presents some limitations that prevents drawing sound conclusions about this effect. 


Our second hypothesis detaches from the fact that, for parallel activation to take place, and for cognateness to facilitate the acquisition of a word form in a given language, the child must be familiar with the (phonologically similar) translation of the word, in the other language. If the child is not previously familiar with one of the word forms, the acquisition of its translation in  language cannot be facilitated by cognateness. This implies that, if cognateness facilitates the acquisition of a word form, it can only do so after the child has acquired one of the word forms of the translation pair. Given that children are more likely to acquire words from languages to which they are exposed more often [@david2008individual; @cattani2014much; @thordardottir2006bilingual], the acquisition of words in the language of lower exposure should, on average, be more susceptible to the effect of cognateness. Therefore, we hypothesised that the effect of cognateness for words in the language of lower exposure would be larger than in the language of higher exposure.


In line with this hypothesis, the vocabulary size associated with linguistic similarity that Floccia et al. reported was larger in the additional language vocabulary than in English vocabulary. Most participants in their sample were English-dominant, meaning that their relative amount of exposure to English was larger than in the additional language. Therefore, participants may have, on average, learnt the English word-form of translation equivalents earlier than the word-form in the additional language.  If this is the case, then the acquisition of English words by English-dominant participants would rarely benefit from their cognate status (the other word-form is not available yet), while the acquisition of words in the additional language would benefit from their phonological similarity with the (available) English form. To test this hypothesis, we conditioned the effect of cognateness to the relative degree of exposure to the language.


In summary, we investigated the role of cognateness in bilingual word acquisition (conditional to the degree of relative exposure to the language) as possible mechanism to account for the facilitation  of language similarity on bilingual children's vocabulary size. We hypothesised that cognate words would be acquired earlier than non-cognate words, and that this effect should be larger for words in the language with lower exposure. Using an online vocabulary checklist--carefully designed specifically for this study--we collected data from a sample of children aged `r min(floor(participants$age))` to `r max(floor(participants$age))` months learning Catalan and/or Spanish, with varying degrees of exposure to each language. We then modelled the probability of participants being reported by their parents to understand and/or say each word in the checklist, conditional to its cognate status in Catalan and Spanish and participants' degree of exposure to the corresponding language, while adjusting for participants' age and the item's lexical frequency.
