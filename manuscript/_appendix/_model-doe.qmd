As a robustness check, we fit a model similar to the one described in the main manuscript, but including lexical frequency and language degree of exposure as separate predictors, instead of the composite measure *Exposure*. Language degree of exposure (*DoE*) was included in interaction with *Age* and *Cognateness*, while lexical frequency (*Frequency*) was included as a main effect. @tbl-coefs-doe shows a comparison between the posterior distribution of the regression coefficients of both models. Overall, results are equivalent.
